    summary: |
      Project Manager with 5+ years of turning chaos into neatly delivered projects, 
      balancing digital operations, 
      cross-functional teams, 
      and strategic partnerships across U.S. and Dubai markets. 
      Fluent in Agile (Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall), 
      leading 50+ projects a month with 15 internal teammates and 70+ global providers without losing my sanity (or the deadlines).
